# ELOfootball

This application uses a simple implementation of the World Football Elo Rating System to rank the teams of the Premier League, from season 2000/2001 to 2015/2016, and compute the expectancies for two selected teams in a given match.

The user could select a home team and an away team and see its ELO ratings compared and the computed probabilities for each possible result of a match between them:

* "H": Home Win
* "D": Draw
* "H": Away Win

You could learn more about the World Football Elo Rating System in [ELOratings.net](http://eloratings.net) or in its [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Football_Elo_Ratings).

This is a course project for the Coursera Data Science Specialization course: [Developing Data Products](https://www.coursera.org/course/devdataprod). Do not expect high accuracy in the predictions!

Results and data from previous matchs was obtained from [football-data.co.uk](football-data.co.uk).
