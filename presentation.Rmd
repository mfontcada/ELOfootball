## ELOfootball application

This application uses a simple implementation of the World Football Elo Rating System to rank the teams of the Premier League, from season 2000/2001 to 2015/2016, and compute the expectancies for two selected teams in a given match.

## Predict results

The user could select a home team and an away team and see its ELO ratings compared and the computed probabilities for each possible result of a match between them:

* "H": Home Win
* "D": Draw
* "H": Away Win
